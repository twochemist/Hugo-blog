      <description>DYOR Rover Objective This project focuses on the design, development and manufacturing of a rover that can autonomously navigate covering aspects such as control, sensorization, programming and planning of robotic systems. The DYOR robot follows a very basic approach and it is dependent on ultrasonic sensors and a digital compass with Arduino. The robot is a standalone system and the autonomous navigation is done by the onboard controller. The methodology implemented is commonly used in robotic and informatics.</description>
